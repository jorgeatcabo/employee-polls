## Description

You have been asked by the HR department of your company to build an application that employees can use internally. In order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, HR has requested you have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. To give employees incentive to use your application, HR will give a prize each quarter for the top employees who have created and answered the most polls.

The "Employee Polls" Web App lets an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

Users are able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted and post polls.

## App Functionality
This application have a way of impersonating/logging in as an existing user having a dropdown that appears at the root of the application that lets the user select a user from the list of existing users.

Information about the logged in user appears on the page.Once the user logs in, the user is able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page, which is located at the root. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom). The unanswered polls are shown by default, and the name of the logged in user is visible on the page.

 If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in the address bar, the user is asked to sign in and then the requested page is shown. The application allows the user to log out and log back in.

When a poll is clicked on the home page, the following is shown:
- Text “Would You Rather”;
- Avatar of the user who posted the polling question; and
- Two options.

For answered polls, each of the two options contains the following:
- Text of the option;
- Number of people who voted for that option; and
- Percentage of people who voted for that option.

The option selected by the logged-in user should be clearly marked.

## Data

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions
